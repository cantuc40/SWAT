# SWAT

SWAT is a web application built on a MERN stack that allows the user to manage and track various faults they find in their working projects. As of August 01 2022, the Project is currently in development.

## Getting Started and Prerequisites

Before running SWAT, download the following:  

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

Once node.js and Docker are installed, git clone the repository and make the file

Keep in mind that it will take a while for the images to build, so be patient.
